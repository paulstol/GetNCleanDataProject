Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals TimeAcceleration-XYZ and TimeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'Time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (TimeBodyAcceleration-XYZ and TimeGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (TimeBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ and TimeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (TimeBodyAccelerationMag, TimeGravityAccelerationMag, TimeBodyAccelerationJerkMag, TimeBodyGyroMag, TimeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FrequencyBodyAcceleration-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, FrequencyBodyGyro-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMag, FFrequencyBodyGyroMag, FrequencyBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'Frequency' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

These mean of all values for each Subject-Activity pair was taken and constitutes the complete set of variables listed below:
